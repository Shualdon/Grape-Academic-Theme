  abstract = {Understanding and predicting the charge transport properties of π-conjugated materials is an important challenge for designing new organic electronic devices, such as solar cells, plastic transistors, light-emitting devices, and chemical sensors. A key component of the hopping mechanism of charge transfer in these materials is the Marcus reorganization energy which serves as an activation barrier to hole or electron transfer. While modern density functional methods have proven to accurately predict trends in intramolecular reorganization energy, such calculations are computationally expensive. In this work, we outline active machine learning methods to predict computed intramolecular reorganization energies of a wide range of polythiophenes and their use toward screening new compounds with low internal reorganization energies. Our models have an overall root mean square error (RMSE) of ±0.113 eV, but a much smaller RMSE of only ±0.036 eV on the new screening set. Since the larger error derives from high-reorganization energy compounds, the new method is highly effective to screen for compounds with potentially efficient charge transport parameters.}

  abstract = {Organic π-conjugated polymers with a triplet ground state have been the focus of recent research for their interesting and unique electronic properties, arising from the presence of the two unpaired electrons. These compounds are usually built from alternating electron-donating and electron-accepting monomer pairs which lower the HOMO–LUMO gap and yield a triplet state instead of the typical singlet ground state. In this paper, we use density functional theory calculations to explore the design rules that govern the creation of a ground-state triplet conjugated polymer and find that a small HOMO–LUMO gap in the singlet state is the best predictor for the existence of a triplet ground state, compared to previous use of a pro-quinoidal bonding character. This work can accelerate the discovery of new stable triplet materials by reducing the computational resources needed for electronic-state calculations and the number of potential candidates for synthesis.}
