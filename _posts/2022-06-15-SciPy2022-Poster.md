<h1>Introduction</h1>

Using quantum mechanical calculation in order to calculated molecular properties for the discovery of new materials can be a slow and expensive method.
By combining those calculations with machine learning methods and genetic algorithms we accelerated the search for nnovel conjugated polymers with optimized properties.

<h2>Marcus Reorganization Energy</h2>

Marcus reorganization energy (*Î»*) describe the energy barrier for a hole transfer. Four different calculations are reuiqred to calculate the reoeganization energy of a molecule:
1. Energy of the optimized neutral molecule
2. Energy of the optimized cationic molecule
3. Energy of the neutral molecule at the cation grometry
4. Energy of the cationic molecule at the neutral geometry
Those calculation can pose a great computational cost which increase exponentially with the number of atoms in the molecule.
